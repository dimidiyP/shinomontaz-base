<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a tire storage management system from scratch, covering core functionality and deploying it using Docker and Nginx. A significant portion of the trajectory involved extensive debugging of deployment issues, particularly persistent Nginx configuration problems related to HTTPS and Docker volume mounts, and Git/CI/CD failures. The engineer demonstrated strong diagnostic capabilities by analyzing logs and network states, iteratively resolving complex infrastructure challenges. Concurrently, the AI engineer began implementing a large set of new features including UI/UX refinements, dynamic form fields, PDF generation, and a substantial RetailCRM integration for automatic order synchronization and status management. Towards the end, a comprehensive automated testing framework using Playwright was introduced, and further enhancements to existing features (e.g., bulk deletion, phone field validation, table display) were in progress, alongside continued debugging of frontend display issues and the PDF act editor.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack web system (FastAPI + React + MongoDB) for tire storage management, mirroring .
**Core Features:** User authentication (Admin/User roles), Admin dashboard with functions: Store, Issue, View Records, Edit Record Form, Edit Act Form, Manage Users. Record storage includes auto-assigned unique number, timestamp, status, user name, and printable PDF act with customizable template. Record issuance involves searching records, displaying matches, status updates. View Records shows a filterable table, with Excel import/export. Dynamic record and act form editing, managing user permissions for all main functions.
**Post-Initial Requirements & Current Enhancements:** Remove test login data. Fix PDF act printing server connection. Single editing window for form settings. Add record deletion with permissions. Implement advanced sorting in record view. Allow adding *new* attributes, not just editing. Change browser title to –•—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –®–∏–Ω and badge to Made in –®–ë–®.
**Latest Requirements:** Mass record deletion with user permissions. Clean up test records after testing. Configurable visible fields in record view. RetailCRM integration: sync orders with , specific field mappings (FIO->full_name, phone->phone, tochka_vydachi->storage_location, type_avto_zakaz->car_brand, order number->custom_field), create records ONLY if RetailCRM status is —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–µ (later —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ –≤—ã–¥–∞—á—É) AND paymentStatus=paid. Status sync to RetailCRM on local store/issue, with restrictions (max 3 auto actions, no change if RetailCRM is already final status). Add non-editable —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å –≤ Retail field, visible only in record list/detail. –†–∞—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å–∞–º if RetailCRM status changes but local doesn't match. Increase phone field to 14 characters. Sort record list by number descending. PDF Act: –û–û–û –†–∏—Ç–µ–π–ª as –•—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å. Detail view for records, with Take to Storage and Print Act buttons. Drag&drop reordering for form fields. Improved table scrolling (top/bottom scrollbars). Export records with order numbers. Import: skip duplicates by number, report count.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation and thorough testing of the –ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ (dynamic field addition/removal with confirmation). (Drag&drop reordering of fields is partially done, but field addition/removal not explicitly addressed.)
-   Full implementation and thorough testing of the –ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã –ê–∫—Ç–∞ (customizable PDF template editor should reflect changes made to the printed act).
-   Confirmation of –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏ access rights setup (checkboxes and admin-only creation) for all 6 blocks, and full testing.
-   Complete the UI for mass record deletion (resolve code duplication and ensure full functionality).
-   Implement configurable visible fields in –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π.
-   Implement export with record order numbers and duplicate checking during import (backend is done, frontend integration and reporting duplicates needed).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on addressing user feedback following the implementation of several major features. Specifically, the engineer was focused on two critical issues reported by the user in Chat 395:

1.  **RetailCRM Status Correction**: The user requested changing the RetailCRM filter status from —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–µ to —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ –≤—ã–¥–∞—á—É for creating records. The AI engineer has successfully modified  to reflect this change (Chat 396-397). This part is complete on the backend.
2.  **PDF Act Editor Functionality**: The user reported that changes made to the act's content and design were not reflecting in the act's editor, which defeats the purpose of the dynamic editor. This indicates an issue with how the act template data is loaded, saved, or rendered within the frontend editor component. The AI engineer had just started investigating this by looking at the relevant section in  for –ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã –ê–∫—Ç–∞ (Chat 398-401).

Additionally, the frontend UI for **mass record deletion** was noted as *partially implemented* with existing code duplication (Chat 394). The backend for bulk deletion, RetailCRM integrations (excluding the latest status change), PDF generation, phone field length, and sorting by record number have all been confirmed as working via comprehensive backend testing (Chat 393-394). The automated testing infrastructure is also set up.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to continue debugging and fixing the PDF Act editor functionality in  to ensure that it correctly loads and allows editing of the act's template.
