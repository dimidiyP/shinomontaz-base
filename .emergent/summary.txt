<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully implemented and stabilized a comprehensive tire storage management system. The trajectory highlights a multi-phase development process: initial setup (React, FastAPI, MongoDB, Docker, Nginx), extensive debugging of infrastructure issues (Nginx configuration, Docker build, CI/CD pipelines, Git errors), and significant feature expansion. Key feature implementations included: RetailCRM integration, dynamic form fields, robust PDF generation with Cyrillic support, bulk deletion, and a major new Tire Shop Calculator module. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving in complex environments, particularly resolving persistent deployment and frontend rendering issues, duplicate code, and authentication failures. Towards the end, the focus shifted to refining the calculator module's UX, short links, admin management, and resolving recent production issues related to routing, display of calculator results, and authorization.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack system for tire storage, mirroring . Initial features: user authentication (Admin/User), Admin dashboard (Store, Issue, View Records, Edit Record Form, Edit Act Form, Manage Users), auto-assigned unique numbers, timestamps, statuses, user names, printable PDF acts with customizable templates, record issuance (search, display, status updates), filterable table with Excel import/export, dynamic record/act form editing, and user permission management.

Subsequent requirements: remove test login data, fix PDF act printing server connection, single editing window for form settings, add record deletion with permissions, advanced sorting, adding new attributes (not just editing), change browser title to –•—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –®–∏–Ω and badge to product of shbsh.

Latest requirements: mass record deletion, clean up test records, configurable visible fields, RetailCRM integration (sync orders with , specific field mappings, record creation only if status is —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ –≤—ã–¥–∞—á—É AND paymentStatus=paid, status sync on local store/issue with restrictions, non-editable —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å –≤ Retail field, –†–∞—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å–∞–º for discrepancies), increase phone field to 14 chars, sort record list by number descending, PDF Act with –û–û–û –†–∏—Ç–µ–π–ª as –•—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å, detailed record view with Take to Storage and Print Act buttons, drag&drop reordering for form fields, improved table scrolling, export with order numbers, import with duplicate skipping and reporting.

New Tire Shop Calculator: public access without auth, admin management for services/time/cost/formulas (based on tire size/type/quantity/runflat), separate calculators for passenger/truck with editable hourly rates, unique short links for calculations (e.g., , 7-day TTL), info tooltips for services, interactive selection with real-time recalculation. Display only total cost to client, hide time details.

Implemented mass deletion UI with checkboxes and a dedicated column. Added a new public Tire Shop Calculator section, its admin panel, and associated state/functions. Modified main  for public calculator routing. Removed calculator button from login form. Fixed various duplicate code blocks and general syntax errors. Updated table headers to use dynamic field labels instead of hardcoded strings. Fixed calculator result display to hide time and show short URLs with copy functionality. Fixed login redirection logic.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation and thorough testing of –ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ (dynamic field addition/removal with confirmation). (Drag&drop reordering is partially done).
-   Confirmation of –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏ access rights setup (checkboxes and admin-only creation) for all 6 blocks, and full testing.
-   Implement configurable visible fields in –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π.
-   Implement export with record order numbers and duplicate checking during import (backend is done, frontend integration and reporting duplicates needed).
-   Addressing lingering issues with the Tire Shop Calculator, specifically the display of calculation results for saved short links, which currently return empty results.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing three critical issues reported by the user:
1.  **Calculator link showing empty results**: The user reported that links like  returned empty calculation results. The backend was confirmed to return data, indicating a frontend routing or data fetching issue. The AI engineer corrected  in  to use  instead of  and added expired link handling.
2.  **Stale field names in record view**: The user noted that after updating attribute labels, the –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π table still displayed old, hardcoded names like –§–ò–û instead of dynamically updated ones. The AI engineer added a  function and updated table headers in  to dynamically fetch labels from the form configuration.
3.  **Missing Calculator Management in menu**: The admin panel for the calculator was not visible in the dashboard menu. The AI engineer identified that the  user lacked the  permission and updated the default admin permissions in . A duplicate Public Calculator block in the frontend was also removed.

The last action was to check frontend logs after restarting services, which only showed webpack warnings and successful compilation.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Check the frontend to confirm that the calculator links now display results, table headers are dynamic, and the calculator admin menu item is visible for admin users.
</optional_next_step>
