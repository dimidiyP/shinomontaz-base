The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive tire storage management system from scratch, adhering to the user's detailed requirements. The initial phase focused on building the core application with authentication, record creation, search, and viewing. The second major phase involved setting up Docker-based deployment with Nginx and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. This phase was heavily characterized by extensive debugging of deployment issues, including Node.js version incompatibilities, Docker container build failures due to volume mounts, and persistent SSH authentication problems with GitHub Actions. The AI iteratively troubleshooted these, demonstrating strong diagnostic capabilities by analyzing logs and network configurations. Finally, the engineer began implementing a new batch of feature requests, covering UI/UX adjustments, PDF generation fixes, record deletion, and advanced sorting, which was still ongoing at the end of the trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack web application similar to  for tire storage management, initially suggesting Node.js but confirming FastAPI + React + MongoDB.
**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Authentication:** Login with roles (Admin: /, User: /).
2.  **Admin Dashboard:** Buttons for Записать на хранение (Store), Выдать с хранения (Issue), Просмотр сделанных записей (View Records), Изменение формы записи (Edit Record Form), Изменение формы Акта (Edit Act Form), Управление пользователями (Manage Users).
3.  **Record Storage:** Form fields (FIO, phone, extra phone, car brand, parameters, size, storage location - select list). Auto-assign unique number, timestamp, Взята на хранение status, and user's name. Generate printable PDF act with customizable template.
4.  **Record Issuance:** Search by unique number, FIO, or phone (case-insensitive, exact match). Display multiple matching records with Взята на хранение status. Clickable records show full info with Выдать с хранения button, changing status to Выдана с хранения after confirmation. Back button functionality.
5.  **View Records:** Table of all records (all statuses) with column filtering. Export to Excel. Import from Excel (same format, new unique numbers assigned).
6.  **Edit Record Form:** Dynamically modify columns/names for record form. Unique number, timestamp, status, and user name fields are non-editable/non-deletable. New fields are empty for old records. Deletion requires confirmation due to data loss.
7.  **Edit Act Form:** Edit PDF act template, adding text or auto-generated parameters.
8.  **User Management:** View all users, assign access rights (checkboxes) for each of the 6 main functions. Admin user has full, unchangeable rights and can create new users.

**Post-initial Build Requirements (from Chat 174):**
1.  Remove test login/password data from the first page.
2.  Fix no server connection error during PDF act printing.
3.  Display only one editing window for Изменение формы Акта.
4.  Add record deletion in Просмотр записей with configurable user permissions.
5.  Implement sorting (ascending for numbers/dates, Russian then English alphabet for text) in Просмотр записей.
6.  Allow adding new attributes, not just editing existing ones, in Настройка атрибутов записи.
7.  Display only one editing window in Настройки атрибутов.
8.  Change browser title to Хранение Шин.
9.  Change Made with Emergent badge to Made in ШБШ.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** FastAPI (Python) backend, React frontend, MongoDB database.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for application packaging and orchestration.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture, with a React single-page application for the frontend, a FastAPI application for the backend API, and MongoDB as the database. Services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, exposed via Nginx.



-   ****: This is the main FastAPI application file.
    -   **Summary**: Handles all backend logic, including user authentication (JWT), database interactions (MongoDB), CRUD operations for records, user management, PDF generation, and Excel import/export.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created with full authentication, record creation, search, and view endpoints. Later updated to include API endpoints for PDF generation, Excel import/export, dynamic form management, and user permissions. Recent edits added the delete record endpoint and potentially new user management functions.
-   ****: The main React component for the user interface.
    -   **Summary**: Defines the application's routes, components (login, record form, tables, admin panels), and handles API calls to the backend. It dynamically renders different views based on user roles and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created for the MVP (login, record creation, basic view/search). Progressively updated to include all required functionalities: PDF generation, Excel import/export, user management, dynamic form editing, and comprehensive record display with filtering. Recent changes aimed at removing redundant UI elements, adding delete functionality, and implementing sorting.
-   ****: Contains the main CSS styles for the React application.
    -   **Summary**: Provides the styling for the frontend, likely using Tailwind CSS directives based on the initial project setup.
    -   **Changes**: Updated during initial bulk file write to set up the base functional UI. No specific functional changes indicated for this file later on, likely minor style adjustments.
-   ****: The main HTML file served by the frontend.
    -   **Summary**: The entry point for the React application. It loads the compiled JavaScript and CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to change the browser title to Хранение Шин and update the Made with Emergent badge to Made in ШБШ.
-   ****: Defines the multi-container Docker application.
    -   **Summary**: Orchestrates the , , , and  services, defining their build contexts, ports, dependencies, and environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created during deployment setup. Critical change involved removing the bind volume mount () for the  service to ensure the  folder generated inside the container during image build was not overwritten by the local host directory. Also contains environment variable definitions for inter-service communication.
-   ****: Dockerfile for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Summary**: Defines how the backend Docker image is built, including Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Created to package the FastAPI application.
-   ****: Dockerfile for the React frontend.
    -   **Summary**: Defines how the React Docker image is built, including Node.js version, yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing a new batch of feature requests from the user, specifically focusing on UI/UX improvements and adding new functionalities. The following actions were observed:

1.  **UI/UX Refinements**:
    *   Removal of test login/password data from the initial login page (likely ).
    *   Changing the browser tab title to Хранение Шин and updating the Made with Emergent badge to Made in ШБШ (modifying ).
    *   Addressing redundant UI elements by consolidating Изменение формы Акта and Настройка атрибутов записи to show only one editing window instead of three.

2.  **Functional Enhancements**:
    *   Started working on resolving the no server connection error during PDF act printing, implying changes to both frontend (calling the PDF generation endpoint) and backend (ensuring the PDF endpoint works).
    *   Added a new access permission for deleting records and implemented the backend endpoint for record deletion (likely modifications to  for a new API route and permission checks).
    *   Began implementing sorting functionality in the Просмотр записей table, with specific rules for numerical, date, and alphabetical (Russian then English) sorting.
    *   Continued work on enabling the addition of *new* attributes (fields) in the Настройка атрибутов записи section, not just editing existing ones.

The last successful action was writing to  and restarting supervisorctl (Chat 202), indicating active development on the frontend components for these new features. The AI engineer then stated, Теперь все основные изменения внесены. Давайте закоммитим изменения и задеплоим на сервер (Chat 203), signaling that this batch of feature development is considered complete for a commit and deployment.
